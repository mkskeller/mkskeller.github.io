I have run a working group at the [Privacy Academy](https://akademie-datenschutz.eu/en/home-2/), a week-long event organised by students of the [German National Academic Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/).

Below are a few slide decks I have used there:

- [Programming MPC](https://mkskeller.github.io/files/programming.pdf): Non-linear computation over arithmetic circuits such as comparisons and fixed-point computation
- [Mixed-circuit computation](https://mkskeller.github.io/files/mixed.pdf): Protocols to combine arithmetic and binary computation
- [Computation with a dishonest majority](https://mkskeller.github.io/files/dishonest.pdf): Computation based on homomorphic encryption and oblivious transfer
