MP-SPDZ is the leading open-source research prototype for multi-party computation, a major privacy-enhancing technology. In this talk, I will present more recent developments in MP-SPDZ. On the protocol side, this includes secure shuffling, which enables more efficient data analytics, and the switch to SoftSpokenOT, a more secure and flexible basis for scaling two-party computation. In addition, I will cover MP-SPDZ's approach to scaling computation efficiently, which has been inspired by HyCC (CCS'18).
