MP-SPDZ is an MPC framework supporting more than 30 protocol variants in all commonly used security models and computation domains. By security model, we mean the choice of total number of parties, number of corrupted parties, and level of corruption (semi-honest or malicious). By computation domain we mean mathematical domain underlying the relevant cryptographic techniques (secret sharing or garbled circuits). MP-SPDZ supports computation modulo a prime or a power of two as well as computation in fields of characteristic two.
