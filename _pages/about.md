I'm a senior research scientist at [CSIRO's Data61](https://data61.csiro.au/), a research unit of Australia's national science agency. I'm the maintainer of [MP-SPDZ](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ), a versatile framework for multi-party computation. My work focuses on practical multi-party computation and its application to privacy-preserving machine learning.
